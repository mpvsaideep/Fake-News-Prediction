# Fake News Prediction using LSTM Approach

## Overview
Welcome to our Fake News Prediction project! This project aims to leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict and classify news articles as either real or fake. We have utilized a Kaggle dataset to train and evaluate our model.

## Project Structure
1.) Dataset
We have employed the Kaggle dataset, which includes a collection of news articles labeled as either real or fake. The dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing our LSTM model.

2.) LSTM Model
Our primary focus is on utilizing LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The model is trained on the provided dataset to learn patterns and features that distinguish between real and fake news.

3.) Dependencies
Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the code. Common libraries used in this project include TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.

4.) Code Structure

## Conclusion
Our Fake News Prediction project utilizing LSTM showcases the potential of deep learning models in addressing real-world challenges. The achieved accuracy of 92% underscores the effectiveness of our approach in discerning between genuine and fake news. We hope this project contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and enhance the reliability of information in the digital age.
